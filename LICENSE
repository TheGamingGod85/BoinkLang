   No warranties, no guarantees, and absolutely no tech support from me.  

3. If you make something cool using this software, you are legally obligated*

   with mysterious bugs that disappear whenever you try to debug them.  

By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,  
and immediately ignored these conditions.  

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
